To use, download your location history from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and upload to the website. The entire application runs in your browser, meaning none of your information is sent anywhere else.

## Local development
Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to host the website at `http://localhost:1234/`.
